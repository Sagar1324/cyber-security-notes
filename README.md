# Introduction to cyber security:
# Cyber security: 
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information.
# Types of cyber security:
# 1.Phishing:
A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a web site, in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person.
# 2.Ransomware:
Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that threatens to publish or blocks access to data or a computer system, usually by encrypting it, until the victim pays a ransom fee to the attacker.
# 3.Malware:
Malware refers to any intrusive software developed by cybercriminals to steal data and damage or destroy computers and computer systems.
# 4.Social engineering:
Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions. It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.
# 5.Man in the middle attack:
A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a cyber attack in which a threat actor puts themselves in the middle of two parties, typically a user and an application, to intercept their communications and data exchanges.
# 6.zero-day attack:
 A zero-day attack takes place when hackers exploit the flaw before developers have a chance to address it.
 * A zero-day vulnerability is a software vulnerability discovered by attackers before the vendor has become aware of it. Because the vendors are unaware, no patch exists for zero-day vulnerabilities, making attacks likely to succeed.
 * A zero-day exploitis the method hackers use to attack systems with a previously unidentified vulnerability.
 * A zero-day attack is the use of a zero-day exploit to cause damage to or steal data from a system affected by a vulnerability.
